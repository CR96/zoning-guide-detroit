# zoning-guide-detroit

Let's build a website that helps explain Detroit's zoning code.

We started this project on the 2018-09-10 civic tech hackathon at WeWork. Our hackathon slide deck can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pZMpCYmuuGy8EJjk9DJUdPwjpkRc9JUTEUQBDbnh7XU/edit#slide=id.g6099c04ea9_2_0)!

This site uses the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) static site framework along with [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to create site pages and components.

## Getting started

1. Install the Gatsby CLI: `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

2. Clone this repository: `git@github.com:Detroit-Urban-Tech-Meetup/zoning-guide-detroit.git`

3. Enter the directory: `cd zoning-guide-detroit`

4. Next, you `yarn` or `npm install`

5. Replace `<your API key>` with [your Airtable API Key](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219046777-How-do-I-get-my-API-key-) in `example.env` and rename to `.env.development`

6. Start developing with `gatsby develop` - Gatsby will access the Airtable, build nodes, etc and will start serving at `localhost:8000`. You can access the GraphiQL Explorer at `localhost:8000/___graphql`: this is the internal store of all the data that Gatsby can use to build the site.

## Site structure

- We pull data from Airtable with the `gatsby-source-airtable` plugin; this is configured in `gatsby-config.js`. This data is stored in the internal GraphQL API that's accessible at `localhost:8000/___graphql`

- In the `gatsby-node.js` file, we query the internal GraphQL API and generate site pages with that query result.

- This site page points to the template file `src/templates/zone-page.js`: here, another GraphQL API call is made (this one uses the `$zone` variable)

- the React components used in the site are stored in `src/components`:

  - `layout.js` is the wrapper for all site pages
  - `header.js` is used in `layout.js`

- individual site pages that are not generated by `gatsby-node.js` live in `src/pages`:

  - `index.js` is what you see at the site's root, i.e. `localhost:8000`. It has its own GraphQL query as well.
